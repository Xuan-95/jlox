# jlox

Jlox is an interpreter of Lox language builded from scratch based on Java.
This project follows the book [Crafting interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) made by Robert Nystrom.
Right now the implementation is the same of the book.
I hope to have the time to add some additional feature in the future.
